# PoE Marcut (Path of Exile 1 and 2 Market Cut)
You log in to PoE for the day and you have a bunch of unsold items in your merchant tabs.

Are you going to price check every single one of them again? No way, total waste of time.

Instead, PoEMarcut does the math for you in quickly adjusting item prices downward. Hover over an item, press F2+F3 to reduce its price by the % you set. Repeat on the next item. Do it every time you log on until items sell or they reach nothing and you vendor them.

## Usage
1. Run `poemarcut.exe`. The GUI window will open. Configure settings to your liking.
2. Hover your mouse cursor over an item in a merchant tab.
3. Press `F2` (default) or `right-click` to open the item price dialog.
4. Press `F3` (default) to adjust the price text downward by 10% (default) and close the dialog.
   (F3 will change to the next-lowest configured currency when the current amount is 1 or max_discount is exceeded.)

- (Optional) Press `F1` (default) before `F2`  to copy the currency type from the item (only necessary if you want to capture the currency type for conversion)
   
Press `F6` (default) to disable hotkeys if desired. Hotkeys can be toggled from the GUI.

The new price is always rounded down (decimal is truncated), to ensure the price is always reduced, even when the existing price is `2` (which will become `1` unless configured otherwise).

An existing price of `1` will be changed into the next lowest currency if configured.

An optional setting `max_actual_discount` will prevent very low prices from being reduced further, eg `40%` will prevent `2` from being reduced to `1` (50% actual, 40% maximum).

A list of currency conversions is also displayed per current poe.ninja economy data.

## GGG TOS Compliance
Completely [GGG TOS policy compliant](https://www.pathofexile.com/developer/docs#policy) and legal. The tool is a simple keyboard macro that only performs one 'server action' per key press, following the policy.
You have to invoke each action of the tool on each item you want to reprice.

## Installation / Running

Download from [Github Releases](https://github.com/cdrg/poemarcut/releases/latest). Run `poemarcut.exe`.

Alternatively [run the source from the command line](https://github.com/cdrg/poemarcut#running-from-the-command-line) with python.

## Settings
Settings such as hotkeys, price adjustment percentage, leagues, etc can be edited in the GUI and are stored in `settings.yaml`.

Hotkey fields capture physical key presses: click a field and press the desired key or combination. Single keys such as `F1`, letters, and numbers continue to work, and modifier combinations such as `Ctrl+1`, `Ctrl+3`, `Ctrl+Shift+F3`, `Alt+2`, and `Win+F4` are supported.

`settings.yaml` is created with defaults if it doesn't exist at start.

This plain-text file can be edited with any text editor and contains descriptions of each setting.

- Download the repository via one of the options in the green Code button on Github (zip, clone, etc).

- Before first use, initialize poetry's venv by running `poetry install` in the repo directory.

- If needed, [install poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) (via pipx) or use your own python venv of choice.

#### Full Windows instructions
1. Install Python 3.12 or 3.13 from the Microsoft Store app, if you don't already have it installed.
2. Open terminal
3. `python -m pip install --user pipx` to get pipx
4. `.\pipx.exe ensurepath`
5. `pipx install poetry` to get poetry
6. Download/clone source from github somewhere
7. `poetry install` in the source folder to initialize poetry environment for the folder
8. `poetry run python poemarcut_gui.py` (or `poemarcut_cli.py`)

### Building
Run `poetry run build`.

A Windows build is also available through GitHub Actions. Open the **Actions** tab, choose **Build Windows EXE**, and use **Run workflow**. Successful runs upload an artifact containing `poemarcut.exe`, `poemarcut.zip`, and `SHA256SUMS.txt`.
